# Backend environment documentation moved

This file was intentionally moved to the `backEnd` folder to keep backend
documentation and secrets separate from the frontend app.

See the backend copy at:

  backEnd/docs/ENV_VARS.md

If you are working on backend code, open the file above for full environment
variable instructions and examples.
