# Example environment variables for development
# Copy this file to `.env` and fill in the real values. Do NOT commit the real `.env` file.

# This file was moved to the repository's `backEnd` folder to separate backend
# and frontend code. The backend copy lives at:
#
#   backEnd/.env.example
#
# If you need to edit backend environment variables, update the file above.
# The frontend should not contain server-side secrets.
